<h1>Node.js API with Nest : Token Based Authentication & Authorization</h1>

<p>In this tutorial, I  have build a Node.js REST API example using Nest that supports Token Based Authentication with JWT (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken" target="_blank">JSONWebToken</a>).</p>

## Topics covered in this example

- Complete flow of User Signup & Signin with JWT Authentication
- Well defined project structure / folder strucutre and separation of data and business logic.
- Configure Express routes to work with JWT
- Working with Controller, Models, Middlewares and Routes.
- User MySQL database to store our data.
- Implement Refresh token to renew access token.
